## FMECA
- When we have a large number of failures we need a filter function which filters the failures into categories like not so severe failures and severe failures

## RBD
- binary : either works or doesn't 
- cannot distinguish different failure modes

## Fault tree analysis
- can distinguish different failure modes
- Limitation
	- You cannot have statistical dependencies between input failures 

## Markov
- Benefit : We could handle statistical dependent failure situations
- Disadvantage : state models have a tendency to grow dramatically when system size gets larger 

## Petri 
- resolve disadvantage of Markov
	### Fundamentals 
	- Semantic 
		- never between places 
		- never between transitions
