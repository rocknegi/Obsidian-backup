# Requirements of a Closed Loop Control 
- Selection of controller type and calculation of its parameters for Steady state accuracy control difference vanishes for
- Speed: actual value follows desired value as good/fast as possible 
- Stability: no instability of control system due to feedback of system output 
-  Robustness: small changes of parameters of the control plant do not change the properties of the control system â†’ approximations for calculation of control parameters are feasible
