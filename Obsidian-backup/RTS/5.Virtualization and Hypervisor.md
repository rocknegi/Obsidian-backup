### Software-based Virtualization
![[Pasted image 20220203112741.png]]
- some code can run directly on the processor 
- this software based vt is very slow 

### Hardware-assisted virtualization
- 2 modes Guest and Root 
- Application generally runs in the Guest Mode
- When application tries to do something which is not defined in the particular hardware, then there is a trap, which is basically an interrupt .
- The interrupt runs the hypervisor in the root mode and does the CPU emulation
- Then return back in Guest mode and run the application again

### MAF (Major Frame)
- The time in which the repetition takes place 
- Basically the hyper period for the virtual machines running inside he hypervisor
