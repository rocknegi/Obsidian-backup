# Inverse Kinematics

### How to do it.

- In fw Kinematics we calculate the transformation from base CS to EE CS.
- In reverse Kinematics we know the transformation but now we need to calculate the joints angle in order to move the robot to the desired location.

- First calculate the fw then solve the matrices and get this equations for a and b. 
- Then take a^2 + b^2 this makes the calculations simple.

### Edge Cases

#### Case 1
- out of reach of the robot
- cosine ranges is from -1 and 1

#### Case 2

- Max reach of robot so q2 is fully stretched hence 0
- Q1 has atan2(b,a)
- Cannot have unique solutions from 0 to 2pi
- So when you have both cosine and sine take Atan2 as it has a unique solution.

#### Case 3
- 2 sol because cosine property.

#### Case 4
- Inner max circle boundary of robot arm.
- cosine in -1 for pi

#### Case 5
- out of inner reach
