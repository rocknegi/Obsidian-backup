## Asimov‘s Laws of Robotics (1942)
1.  A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection
   does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

## Definition: Robot (Christaller)
Robots are sensorimotor machines that expand human skills. They consist of mechatronic components, sensors and computing architecture as well as a complex control. The complexity of a robot differs significantly from other machines due to the greater number of degrees of freedom and the variety of behaviors.
[T. Christaller, 2001]
