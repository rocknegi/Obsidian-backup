# Maths 
### Orthogonal Vectors
- perpendicular vectors so this means the  Dot product is 0
 ![[2.Calibration#^fefd9a]]
 
### Scalar Product
- Commutative and distributive property hold. 
- Associative does not hold

### Vector Product / Cross Product
- For parallel vectors the cross product is 0
 ![[2.Calibration#^91f402]]
- Magnitude of the cross product is equal to the area of the parallelogram

### Coordinate Systems 
We say that 2 vectors are orthogonal if **they are perpendicular to each other**. i.e. the dot product of the two vectors is zero. ... A set of vectors S is orthonormal if every vector in S has magnitude 1 and the set of vectors are mutually orthogonal.
