# Joints
![[Pasted image 20211205204648.png]]
- links : femur; joint : knee
- kinematic chain is links + joints. Eg legs fingers hands.
- Q1 : how much we have translated along joint axes 
- theta : how much we have rotated around joint axes

# forward kinematics

- Find the translation from base to End effecter
- Links are fixed as their length is already fixed by the manufacturer. Eg length of your femur. This is given by robot manufacturer.    
- Current Joint angles is  provided by the firmware of the robot

- When there is pure translation * rotation just add them
- only works when the  order is first trans then rot
- when two translations just add them
