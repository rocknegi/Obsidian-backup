## Properties
- Recursion creates a stack and calls itself n+1 times 
- Space constraints are there as extra space is required to store the stack.
- Internally uses stack.

- Destroys the stack one by one when out of if condition while descending

- Time complexity O(n+1) so 0(n) 

## Types of Recursion
- Tail 
- Head
- Tree
- Indirect
- Nested

### Tail
- If the recursive call is the last statement and there is nothing after that then it's a tail recursion.
- Function doesn't perform anything at returning time.
- Can easily be converted to loops.

- Loop is better than a tail recursion.

### Head
- ![[Pasted image 20211222121304.png]]
- If the recursive call is the first statement and there is nothing before that then it's a head recursion. 
- Function performs only at returning time.
- Not easily converted to a loop, but can be converted.

### Tree
- ![[Pasted image 20211222121742.png]]
- Call itself more than one time.

### Indirect 
- ![[Pasted image 20211222123204.png]]
- fun a calls fun b , fun b calls fun c , fun c calls fun a
