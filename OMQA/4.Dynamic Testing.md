# Types of testing
1.	Structural Testing : Based on the program Code 
2.	Functional Testing : Based on the specification not on the code
3.	Diversified : Group of special approaches

### Dynamic Testing
- Can also be done in simulated environment.
- Disadvantage : Dynamic testing is never complete. As there are infinite amount of test cases and all of that cannot be tested.   

### Tests are often not reproducible
- When you change the code it might fix an existing issue but it can also negatively effect some other functionality.
- fix this by executing the already executing test cases (regression testing)


# Structural Testing
### Control Flow Testing
- Statement Coverage
	- All the edges are not always covered 
- Branch Coverage
	- Covers all the edges 
	- Not appropriate for Complex Decisions as some parts of the condition are not checked
- Condition/decision coverage
- Minimal multiple condition coverage 
- Modified condition/decision coverage 
	- This technique doesn't care code is evaluated from left to right or vice versa
- Multiple Condition Coverage.
-  Path Coverage
	-  Path : from start node to end node

	-  This `2^32768 - 1` is also the no of test cases

# Data flow testing
- [Definition vs Deceleration](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-definition-and-declaration/)
- c-use : Grab the value of the variable, read it as you need it as an input for some computation 
- p-use : read the variable value because you need it in a decision
- all def tests does not fulfill branch coverage 

# Functional Testing
- completeness is based on the specification and not on the code.
- It is a block box type of technique (not true vice versa not every block box technique belongs to this)
- When state based specifications are there equivalence class partitioning is no the right approach.
