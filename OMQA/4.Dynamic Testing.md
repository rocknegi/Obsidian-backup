## Types of testing
1.	Structural Testing : Based on the program Code 
2.	Functional Testing : Based on the specification not on the code
3.	Diversified : Group of special approaches

## Dynamic Testing
- Can also be done in simulated environment.
- Disadvantage : Dynamic testing is never complete. As there are infinite amount of test cases and all of that cannot be tested.
