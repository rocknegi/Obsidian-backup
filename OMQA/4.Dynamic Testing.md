# Types of testing
1.	Structural Testing : Based on the program Code 
2.	Functional Testing : Based on the specification not on the code
3.	Diversified : Group of special approaches

### Dynamic Testing
- Can also be done in simulated environment.
- Disadvantage : Dynamic testing is never complete. As there are infinite amount of test cases and all of that cannot be tested.   

### Tests are often not reproducible
- When you change the code it might fix an existing issue but it can also negatively effect some other functionality.
- fix this by executing the already executing test cases (regression testing)


# Structural Testing
- Statement Coverage
	- All the edges are not always covered 
- Branch Coverage
	- Covers all the edges 
	- Not appropriate for Complex Decisions as some parts of the condition are not checked
