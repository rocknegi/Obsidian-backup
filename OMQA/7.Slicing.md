## Slicing
- comparable to debugging 
- backward tracing 

## Static Slicing 
- No input values is needed
- node 7 is not a data flow dependency its a control flow dependency
- control flow dependencies are shown with dashed lines
- Always makes a worst case situation 

## Dynamic Slicing 
- Usually is capable to produce a smaller size
