## Product measures
- Draw conclusions based on these measures. Like new product is 2x the size of old product so how much more time will it require 

## Process measures
- Don't refer to a specific product . Refer to the avg product that is produced in this specific process 
- They might be used to check whether the process steps are obeyed 


## Reproducibility 
- LOC is not a good measure like McCabe

## Measures Scale
- Every higher scale has all the properties of the lower level scale + additional properties.
