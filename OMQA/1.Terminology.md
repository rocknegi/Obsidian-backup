# Terms
### Heterogeneous Redundancy 
- People based
- For e.g : On a train the driver's dashboard displays whether all the doors of the train are closed or not and also there is a person standing outside the that tells the driver the same thing.
- If there were no redundancy then the dashboard would be much more safety critical .
- That is why we cannot just depend upon the Technical system. We have to take in account the whole system.   

### Reliability 
- Is just MTBF
- Mean time between failure

### Availability 
- is just like  
- Availability = MTBF/(MTBF+MTTR)

### Failure,Fault,Error
- Correctness is influenced by faults.
- For safety and reliability doesn't depend on faults unless they causes a failure.

### Hazard
- There was no accident but the system is still not safe. 
- Eg: Train crossing gate was not closed when the train was approaching a crossing but there was no accident as no one was trying to cross the railway tracks at that time
