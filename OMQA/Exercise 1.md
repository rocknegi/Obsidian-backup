### Problem 1: Embedded Systems 

a) Please define the general term “system” according to Birolini and explicitly name the parts a system can encompass. Explain your answer in the view of aviation. 

Ans)
- Technical and organizational means for the autonomous fulfillment of a task.
- Generally, a system can consist of hardware, software, people (service and maintenance personnel) and logistic assistance.
- Autopilot, cabin crew, service engineers, engine. 



b) What is the difference to a “technical system”? 
Ans)
-	System where influences by people and logistics are ignored

c) For the analysis of a technical (embedded) system it is crucial to extract it from its environment. How can this be achieved? Please sketch your ideas. 
Ans)
-	

d) Please list important non-functional requirements for embedded systems.
Ans)


#### Problem 2: Reliability vs. Availability 
Please explain the difference between “reliability” and “availability”.

### Problem 3: Safety vs. Security 
Please explain the terms “safety” and “security”. What is meant by “technical safety”? Please give examples for the safety of a failure-free system and the technical safety of a failure afflicted system.

#### Problem 4: Failure, Fault 
What is meant by the terms “failure” and “fault”? Please illustrate your answer by means of the “Ariane 5” disaster (see lecture). 

Ans)
- Fault :  code problem. velocity is measured using type integer.
- Failure :  Incorrect steering commands were sent.

#### Problem 5: Hardware Failures vs. Software Failures 
Please explain the differences between hardware failures and software failures.
