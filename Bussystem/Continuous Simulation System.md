### Continuous vs. discrete signals (time) 
- Defines time when the signal has a defined value 
- Continuous: Signal is defined at all times within an interval [tstart, tend] 
- Discrete: Signals is defined only at specific sample times within a given interval  
### Continuous vs. discrete signals (value)  
- Defines the values that are transmitted by a signal 
- Continuous: Signal may carry any value in given interval [vmin, vmax] 
- Discrete: Signals may carry defined values from an interval [vmin, vmax]
