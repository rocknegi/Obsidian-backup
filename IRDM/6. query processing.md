### Inverted index
- An inverted index is a data structure used in information retrieval systems, search engines, and databases to efficiently store and retrieve information about the presence of words or terms in a collection of documents. It is called "inverted" because it reverses the traditional mapping of documents to terms, making it easier to search for documents that contain specific terms. In an inverted index, the following information is typically stored:

1. **Dictionary**: The dictionary is a list of all unique terms (words or phrases) that appear in the collection of documents. Each term is associated with an identifier or a unique token, such as an integer. The dictionary serves as a lookup table for terms.
    
2. **Posting Lists**: For each term in the dictionary, there is a corresponding posting list. A posting list is a list of document identifiers (or other information) that indicates where the term appears in the documents. The posting list may also contain additional information, such as term frequency (how many times the term appears in a document) or position information (where in the document the term appears).
    
3. **Document IDs**: Document identifiers are typically assigned to each document in the collection. These IDs are used to reference the documents in the posting lists.
    
4. **Term Frequency (Optional)**: In some cases, the posting list includes the term frequency, which is the number of times the term appears in a particular document. This information can be used for ranking and relevance scoring.
    
5. **Position Information (Optional)**: For applications where word order is important (e.g., phrase searching), the posting list may include position information that specifies where in the document each occurrence of the term is located.
