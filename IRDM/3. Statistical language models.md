### Query likelihood approaches
- P(q|d): the prob if you take a document and sample of the it, and you are creating a model that you will construct the query Q by sampling from / drawing terms out of this doc model.

### Multinomial LM
- conjunctive query semantics
	- if one of the query terms is not present in a doc , automatically the prob will be 0.
