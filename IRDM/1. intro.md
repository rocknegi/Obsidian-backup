- lemmatization
	- Lemmatization takes a word and breaks it down to its lemma. For example, the verb "walk" might appear as "walking," "walks" or "walked." Inflectional endings such as "s," "ed" and "ing" are removed. Lemmatization groups these words as its lemma, "walk."

	- Zipf’s Law is a statistical distribution in certain data sets, such as words in a linguistic corpus, in which the frequencies of certain words are inversely proportional to their ranks.
	- The law examines the frequency of words in natural language and how the most common word occurs twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the subsequent word and so on until the least frequent word. The word in the position n appears 1/n times as often as the most frequent one.
