### Vector space model
- **Boolean retrieval model** provides no (or only rudimentary) 
- **ranking of results** severe limitation for large result sets.

- q query d document
### TF * IDF
- Some terms are very frequent in a document and can therefore damped the effect of really insightful terms. They are called stop words.
- Inverse document frequency : dampens the effect of stop words and boost the importance of real terms.

### Dampening 
- If there are super exotic terms which rarely occurs in your document collection. This makes the idf very large
- To lower the weight of super exotic terms, we use logarithmic dampening 
### Precision and recall
- precision: how good the results are
- recall: how many which deserved to be returned are actually returned.
- P high then recall low vice versa

- ### Average Precision
- Precision, recall, and F measure ignore the order of results.
### (Normalized) Discounted Cumulative Gain 
- Docs are not just relevant or non relevant.
- We have diff grades for these docs.

- The log part diminishes the influence of numerator for results that are happening in lower ranks. As the users are only interested in top ranks.
### OKAPI BM25 (best match iteration n 25)

- Generalizes the weight to consider the dependency onto the term frequency.
