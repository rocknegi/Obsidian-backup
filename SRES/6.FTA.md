## Fault tree analysis  
### Gates
 - Events don't have any duration just spikes that it occurred unlike states
 - you enter a state leave the state 
 - NOT gate is not used as it will change a failure state into non failure 
 
 ## Process Context 
 -  Does not turn a bad system into a good one 
 -  it just tells a system is bad or good
