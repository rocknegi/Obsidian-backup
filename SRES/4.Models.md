## FMECA
- When we have a large number of failures we need a filter function which filters the failures into categories like not so severe failures and severe failures

## RBD
- binary : either works or doesn't 
- cannot distinguish different failure modes

## Fault tree analysis
- can distinguish different failure modes
- Limitation
	- You cannot have statistical dependencies between input failures 

## Markov
-
