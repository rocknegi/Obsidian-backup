### Non-functional properties
• **Real-time requirements** Embedded systems often have high requirements
for execution speed and real-time capability, especially in safety-critical systems.
Communication between individual nodes must also usually have real-time
capability and be robust. Specialized and hard-wired architectures have an advantage
over generic ones.
• **Weight, size, energy consumption** These requirements play a major role especially
in mobile or autonomous systems. Highly integrated processing units are
therefore often used.
• **Reliability, maintainability, availability** Since embedded systems are often used
in industrial environments and are not designed for the direct interaction of the
processing unit with humans, the requirements of reliability and availability are
very high. Compared to consumer products, for example, it is not an option to
restart a power plant several times a day because there is a variable overflow
somewhere.
• **Robustness and EMC Robustness** should also be mentioned in this context, as
embedded systems are often used in environments exposed to dirt, liquids or
vibration which they must be able to withstand. A special requirement here is
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). On the one hand, this refers to the system’s
insensitivity to interference from external electromagnetic fields, but on the other
hand it also relates to the fact that it does not unintentionally generate any such
interference itself.
