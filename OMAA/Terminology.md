### Heterogeneous Redundancy 
- People based
- For e.g : On a train the driver's dashboard displays whether all the doors of the train are closed or not and also there is a person standing outside the that tells the driver the same thing.
- If there were no redundancy then the dashboard would be much more safety critical .
- That is why we cannot just depend upon the Technical system. We have to take in account the whole system.
