# Why homogeneous Coordinates
They simplify and unify the mathematics used in graphics:

-   They allow you to represent translations with matrices.
    
-   They allow you to represent the division by depth in perspective projections.
    

The first one is related to affine geometry. The second one is related to projective geometry.
The fourth component is a trick to keep track of perspective projection. When you do a perspective projection, you want to divide by z: x' = x/z, y' = y/z, but this isn't an operation that can be implemented by a 3x3 matrix operating on a vector of x, y, z. The trick that has become standard for doing this is to append a fourth coordinate, w, and declare that x, y, z will always be divided by w after all transformations are applied and before rasterization.

Perspective projection is then accomplished by having a matrix that moves z into w, so that you end up dividing by z. But it also gives you the flexibility to leave w = 1.0 if you don't want to do a divide; for instance if you just want a parallel projection, or a rotation or whatever.

The ability to encode positions as w = 1, directions as w = 0 and use the fourth row/column of a matrix for translation is a nice side benefit, but it's not the primary reason for appending w. One could use affine transformations (a 3x3 matrix plus a 3-component translation vector) to accomplish translation without any w in sight. (One would have to keep track of what's a position and what's a direction, and apply different transformation functions to each; that's a bit inconvenient, but not really a big deal.)

(BTW, mathematically, vectors augmented with w are known as [homogeneous coordinates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates), and they live in a place called [projective space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space). However, you don't need to understand the higher math to do 3D graphics.)

# What is the re-projection error

When a point is computed automatically (ATP), or marked by the user (MTP, GCP, or CP) on at least two images, the 3D coordinates of this point are computed using the camera's internal and external parameters as well as the position of the point in the images. Once the 3D coordinates of the point are computed, the 3D point is reprojected on all the images that it appears. This error depends on the quality of the camera calibration (position and orientation), as well as on the quality of the marked point on the images (position and zoom level at which the point is marked).
