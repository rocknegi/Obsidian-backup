### convolution 
- A convolution is the simple application of a filter to an input that results in an activation. Repeated application of the same filter to an input results in a map of activations called a feature map, indicating the locations and strength of a detected feature in an input, such as an image.
- Convolutional neural networks apply a filter to an input to create a feature map that summarizes the presence of detected features in the input.
- Filters can be handcrafted, such as line detectors, but the innovation of convolutional neural networks is to learn the filters during training in the context of a specific prediction problem.
- How to calculate the feature map for one- and two-dimensional convolutional layers in a convolutional neural network.
