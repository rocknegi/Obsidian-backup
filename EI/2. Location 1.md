### Types of signals 
- Mechanical wave (including sound)
	- A mechanical wave is a wave that is an oscillation of matter, and therefore transfers energy through a medium.
- Electro-magnetic wave (e.g. RF signals, light)
	- Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) consists of waves of the electromagnetic (EM) field, propagating through space, carrying electromagnetic radiant energy. It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, (visible) light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.
- Digital data packet
	- Cellular digital packet data (CDPD) was a wireless data service used to access the Internet and other packet-switched systems over a cellular network. CDPD was normally used by analog advanced mobile phone system (AMPS) standards and was one of the first generation cellular frequencies

### UWB
- We use UWB to bypass the multi path problem when we want to send some data.
- It's useful when there are reflections in the signals when transmitting, as signals don't directly go from a sender to the receiver directly.
- Apple has a dedicated UW chip to calculate the TOF.

### Wifi fingerprinting 
- Wi-Fi fingerprinting is an approach to [indoor asset tracking](https://www.link-labs.com/asset-tracking) where the location and base station ID (BSSID) of each Wi-Fi access point (AP) in a building is recorded as part of a survey. An asset tag then scans the Wi-Fi environment and reports the list of Wi-Fi APs and their associated signal strengths. The database from the survey is then used to estimate the tag’s likely position. This is also how smartphones often estimate their position when they are in areas where GPS does not work, like inside buildings.

- Q Where is the actual measurement and true position
	- ![[Pasted image 20220917184200.png]]
	- The highest point is the actual measurement and the actual position can be anywhere in the shadow(most likely at the highest point)

### Particle filter
- instead of random sample everywhere, resample more at the higher probability locations
