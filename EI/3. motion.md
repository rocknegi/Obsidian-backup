### Whatâ€™s the limit of the sensors?
- saturation
- linear range
- it will saturate at some point

### Acceleration
- High-pass filter (combined with orientation algorithms) can isolate the user acceleration from the gravity component.
- In real world activities, unless you are constantly accelerating (in an ever-speeding car or a rocket), accelerations tend to be transient
- The angular momentum of a body will remain unchanged unless it is acted upon by a torque and that the rate of change of angular momentum is equal to the magnitude of the torque.
- Most MEMS gyroscopes works with Coriolis force on a resonating proof mass
