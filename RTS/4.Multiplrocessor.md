## Multiprocessor system

### System agnostic of shared memory hierarchy
- Maybe this system share memory. Maybe the core in one processor communicate with another using the space of shared memory but the core itself does'nt know about that 
		`multi-core is a particular case  of multiprocessor`
		
		
## Periodic task model
- Phase = Ï† = 0 means task starts from 0

## Scheduling approaches 
### Global Scheduling 
-	jobs can migrate from on processor to another 

### Portioned Scheduling 
- Group of tasks assigned to a particular core
- No migration 

###  Hybrid
- Semi partitioning scheduling.
- Some tasks are allowed to migrate 
- Core clusters are there in processors having a huge no of cores and in some clusters migrating is allowed.
