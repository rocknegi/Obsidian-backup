- The sign is decided based on the fact that if f(x) is +ve or -ne on the upper part where the point x is . Or check the normal vector direction it's -ve where the vector in pointing and -ve on the other side.
- Also the distance of point x to the hyperplane is always the orthogonal shortest distance between them
