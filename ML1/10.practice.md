-  [Why does the overfitting decreases if we choose K to be large in K-nearest neighbors?](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/81866/why-does-the-overfitting-decreases-if-we-choose-k-to-be-large-in-k-nearest-neigh)

  
- What is Regularization in Machine Learning? Regularization refers to **techniques that are used to calibrate machine learning models in order to minimize the adjusted loss function and prevent overfitting or underfitting**.

- What is the difference between parameter and hyperparameter?

	- Model Parameters: These are the parameters in the model that must be determined using the training data set. These are the fitted parameters. **Hyperparameters: These are adjustable parameters that must be tuned in order to obtain a model with optimal performance**

-  What Is Grid Search?
	- Grid search is a tuning technique that attempts to compute the optimum values of hyperparameters. It is an exhaustive search that is performed on a the specific parameter values of a model. The model is also known as an estimator.Grid search exercise can save us time, effort and resources.
