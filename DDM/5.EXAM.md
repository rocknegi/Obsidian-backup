- **Thomas's Write Rule** is a concept used in distributed computing to maintain consistency and avoid conflicts when multiple processes or nodes in a distributed system attempt to write data simultaneously. It is one of the rules or techniques for achieving consensus and ensuring that only one process can modify a shared resource at a time. Thomas's Write Rule is particularly useful in systems that use shared memory or have shared resources that multiple processes may access or modify concurrently.
