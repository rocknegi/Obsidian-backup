- **Thomas's Write Rule** is a concept used in distributed computing to maintain consistency and avoid conflicts when multiple processes or nodes in a distributed system attempt to write data simultaneously. It is one of the rules or techniques for achieving consensus and ensuring that only one process can modify a shared resource at a time. Thomas's Write Rule is particularly useful in systems that use shared memory or have shared resources that multiple processes may access or modify concurrently.
- Can implement fault-tolerant state machine by replicating and running replicas of single state machine. • Provided that – all start in the same state – execute the same request in same order – all operations are deterministic
