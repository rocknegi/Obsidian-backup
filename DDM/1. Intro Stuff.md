 ### L1 Cache
- L1 (Level 1) cache is the fastest memory that is present in a computer system. In terms of priority of access, the L1 cache has the data the CPU is most likely to need while completing a certain task.
- The size of the L1 cache depends on the CPU. Some top-end consumer CPUs now feature a 1MB L1 cache, like the Intel i9-9980XE, but these cost a huge amount of money and are still few and far between. Some server chipsets, like Intel's Xeon range, also feature a 1-2MB L1 memory cache.

### L2 Cache
- L2 (Level 2) cache is slower than the L1 cache but bigger in size. Where an L1 cache may measure in kilobytes, modern L2 memory caches measure in megabytes. For example, AMD's highly rated Ryzen 5 5600X has a 384KB L1 cache and a 3MB L2 cache (plus a 32MB L3 cache).
- The L2 cache size varies depending on the CPU, but its size is typically between 256KB to 32MB. Most modern CPUs will pack more than a 256KB L2 cache, and this size is now considered small. Furthermore, some of the most powerful modern CPUs have a larger L2 memory cache, vastly exceeding 8MB. For example,
- When it comes to speed, the L2 cache lags behind the L1 cache but is still much faster than your system RAM. The L1 memory cache is typically 100 times faster than your RAM, while the L2 cache is around 25 times faster.

### L3 Cache
- Onto the L3 (Level 3) cache. In the early days, the L3 memory cache was actually found on the motherboard. This was a very long time ago, back when most CPUs were just single-core processors. Now, the L3 cache in your CPU can be massive, with top-end consumer CPUs featuring L3 caches up to 32MB, while AMD's revolutionary Ryzen 7 5800X3D CPUs come with 96MB L3 cache. Some server CPU L3 caches can exceed this, featuring up to 128MB.
- The L3 cache is the largest but also the slowest cache memory unit. Modern CPUs include the L3 cache on the CPU itself. But while the L1 and L2 cache exist for each core on the chip itself, the L3 cache is more akin to a general memory pool that the entire chip can make use of.
- The following images show the CPU memory cache levels for an Intel Core i5-3570K CPU launched in 2012 and an AMD Ryzen 5800X CPU, launched eight years later, in 2020. The CPU cache data is in the bottom right corner of the second image.
